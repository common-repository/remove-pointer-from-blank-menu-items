== Description ==

Using a hash symbol as a custom link is a great way to create non-clickable menu items when you want to add a sub-menu. However, it still appears clickable to the end-user, which may be confusing. This plugin will automatically remove the href so it no longer looks clickable.

== Installation ==

Install, activate and you're done.
